# Vending-Machine-CLI: 
Partner capstone project completed with @samkellerphl for coding bootcamp. This project replicates a vending machine program utilizing java! We spent 3 full days tackling this project and had a blast! 

Features:
- Vending Machine "dispenses" beverages, candy, chips, and gum 
- User can naviate through menu's to look at vending machine items, add money, get change, and finish transaction 
- Upon running this program, the vending machine is stocked via an input file
- Customers can feed vending machine bills up to $10
- When the customer purchases an item, the vending machine prints a fun message depending on the item type
- All purchases are audited to prevent theft from the vending machine, each time an action is taken on the machine, it prints a line to the log file
- There is also a hidden menu option that creates a sales report file which shows the total sales since the machine was started 

Tests:
- Junit tests to confirm validity of methods which do money calculations
